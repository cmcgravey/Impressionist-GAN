Josh Freud, Sami Muduroglu, Will O'Brien, and Colin McGravey 

#### Impressionist Art GAN

Development Process

1. Decide on which dataset to use 
2. Download and preprocess data (SAMI) 
    - Use dictionary to store time perions -> paintings
3. Build Generator and Discriminator (COLIN)
    - Find different network architectures to experiment with online 
4. Train (FREUD)
    - Train the network, plot results, and record data 
5. Test 
    - Test actual output of network 
6. Analyze 
    - Analyze results, were we successful
